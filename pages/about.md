My interest in cybersecurity began with my love of problem-solving and fascination with technology, which led me to teach myself web development at 11. Over the years, I've honed my skills, going from a kid with a beaten up HTML manual to a full-stack developer specializing in web application security and penetration testing.

As a software engineer, I use my coding and security knowledge to create secure and accessible websites and web apps. My background in communication and experiences with different audiences and clients allows me to bring trust and value to every project.

I'm also an ethical hacker who doesn't just stop at penetration testing to prevent exploits. I'm all about improving internet security by teaching others how to stay safe while browsing online. I don't think it's enough to just fix problems when they come up, but that education helps to prevent them from happening in the first place.

When Iâ€™m not coding or keeping up with the latest news in cybersecurity, I enjoy drawing, writing, and gaming with my husband while my two mischievous cats beg us for attention.
